 In addition to the 4 graphs, with accompanying scripts, as required, there is a data file, and a dataprep script.  
 To reproduce the graphs, you can download the 5 scripts, and deal with the original data, or the 4 "plot" scripts 
 plus the datafile "power.csv"
 Then of course, change the argument of setwd to your own folder.
